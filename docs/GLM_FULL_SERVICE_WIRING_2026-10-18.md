# GLM full-service wiring

This continues the complete-answer campaign, not its replacement. Public HTTP
stays offline until real service acceptance on both Sparks. Keep the existing
canonical scheduler, tokenizer, request/event semantics and HTTP adapters;
do not wrap the serial CLI in a second admission queue.

## GPU sampling

The full-logit path now has a backend-neutral total-order permutation plan in
elementwise physical IR. Every compare/exchange stage is a disjoint matching;
stage publication precedes the next matching. The existing stochastic final
program retains max-shifted temperature softmax, minimal top-p prefix,
ordered F64 mass folds and the request's counter-based draw. Ordering is by
descending logit, then ascending token ID. F32 input is never narrowed to BF16.

Private CUDA lowering emits initialization/finite validation, compare/exchange,
parallel probability evaluation, and final selection. A prepared integration
owner captures the whole fixed schedule at startup. Only sampling parameters
are uploaded and eight token/status bytes per live output are downloaded.
The request seed/index is independent of batch placement or retry. Workspace,
mailboxes, transfers and graph ownership are allocated once and explicitly
drained/closed. No runtime compilation, model payload hashing, reference-engine
dependency or host sampling fallback is introduced.

GLM full-logit rank binding requires the separately compiled sampling AOT. The
existing greedy-head path remains available. This is a capability requirement,
not a claim that the full service has been installed or qualified. The initial
bitonic schedule prioritizes complete semantics; its O(V log-squared V) ordering
cost and ordered mass folds must be measured, not advertised as optimal.

`cmd/full_sampling_probe` is an offline physical fixture using the actual
prepared owner and canonical request parameters. Its host sampler is an
independent test control, not a production dependency or a universal numerical
oracle. Cases cover unrestricted sampling, top-k/top-p, greedy ties, values
distinguished by F32 but not BF16, nonfinite rejection, varying/zero live rows,
and repeated request-index draws. Kernel sanitizer and actual-owner results
must be recorded before full-model use.

## Remaining execution boundary

The canonical HTTP worker must bind the real batched GLM TP owner. A terminal
request can release recurrent/KV slot ownership only after all submitted work
retires and both ranks acknowledge the exact request ID/generation. Requests
cancelled before their first GPU step also need a valid no-state retirement.
Absent rows in a batch are not evidence that a request has finished. Do not
reuse a slot by inferring liveness from the most recent batch.

Acceptance requires complete JSON and SSE answers, mixed concurrent
prefill/decode, seeded GPU sampling, stop/EOS/usage consistency, cancellation
and HTTP disconnect with reuse, saturation/capacity recovery and failed-rank
drain. Model tests, echo workers and transfer doubles alone cannot pass this
gate. Admission must respect the measured context/concurrency capacity under
100 GiB per Spark, 16 GiB host reserve and zero swap.
